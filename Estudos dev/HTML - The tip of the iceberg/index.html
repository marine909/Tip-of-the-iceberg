            Hello. It's a pleasure havin you

      <h2>The tip of the iceberg </h2>
      <p>
        Hello. I'm Marina and it's a pleasure having you here in my archive. This is the very first HTML that I make and I wanted to make this and opportunity to introduce myself.
        <br>
        I am a 31yo brazilian who is trying to find their own path.
        <br>
        I hold a bachelor degree as an Agricultural Engineer, but since last year (2024) I've been feeling a little lost in my professional life. 
        <br>
        Don't get me wrong, I love having studied Agriculture, but I started feelings stuck at my past -corporate- job. I didn't feel fully recognized for my contributions and that made me reconsider a few things in life.
        <br>
        I realized that I missed learning new things!! So here I am. I know I'm still at the beginning of my journey, but I'm confident that my determination and adaptability will help me succeed as a software developer.
       And the truth is, I'm having lots of fun learning new things. Yay!
       <br>

       Here are some pictures of my cats:
